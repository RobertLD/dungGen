Suggested changes to mapGen Function

If: The roomID is dynamicly generated from the dungeonID seed it would allow
all of the rooms to have a unique seed, and also reduce the complexity of our
current algorithm.
If: The roomID variable is reduced into a 1D array it is possible for the roomIDs to be
assigned following the function: "1 + 4n" where n is the room number. The roomID returned
by this would be the second room (regardless of its position) the numbers in-between would
determine its connecing rooms if there are to be any via the seed.
If: The 2D array of RoomIDs is kept, we can possibly apply some logic on the array to simply reduce
some columns and rows to zero  (or None) and use the spatial orientation of the array to determine the
connections of the room. This would resolve the reused seed problem as well as the duplicate rooms (spatially)

Things to fix:
Remove redundant seeds. It should not be possible to generate rooms directly on top of eachother
The function sometimes returns before all True values have been overwritten with room pointers

Overall goal:
Create a data object that gives enough information to construct a room. As well as the spatial orientation of said room.
